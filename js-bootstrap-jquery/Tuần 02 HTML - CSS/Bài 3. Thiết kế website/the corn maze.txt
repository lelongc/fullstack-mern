The Corn
Maze
Welcome to the Sunny Acres Corn Maze. We first heard about mazes from
agricultural exchange students who came from England in 1985. In Europe,
mazes are very popular in castle gardens. After hearing about the mazes in
Europe, we thought it would be a great idea to build one of our own right outside
of Council Bluffs.
Since 1997, thousands of people have enjoyed our Corn Mazes. We hope that
your family gets as much enjoyment out of this year's Corn Maze as we did
building it! Our family would like to invite your family to come out and visit us at
this year's Corn Maze and Autumn Fest.
Our new 15-acre maze (with over 4 miles of trails to explore) is filled with twist
and turns that's good fun for adults and kids alike! See how adventurous you are
as you wind through the maze while taking an interactive quiz. Answer the
questions correctly and receive additional clues to solve the maze. For families
with young children, our maze is filled with jokes, riddles and quests. Try to be the
first in your group to punch out your quest card by visiting the secret spots. This
maze is the perfect size and height for little ones. Besting places and educational
displays are scattered throughout.
There is no water available in the maze. Make sure you bring water bottles with you! No one under the age of 12
will be allowed in the maze without an adult at any time
