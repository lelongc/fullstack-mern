Getting Started
Scrapbooking is the practice of combining photos, memorabilia, and stories in an album,
preserving memories for future generations. In recent years, scrapbooking has become a
$300 million dollar industry as the public has discovered the joys of creating albums for
families and friends. Online Scrapbooks is here to help you with all of your scrapbooking
needs.
Preserving Your Memories
Scrapbook albums have existed since the
beginning of photography. However, the sad
fact is that photographs and most printed
material are not permanent: they will fade and
yellow with age. Scrapbookers of today are
aware of these problems, and the industry is
providing remedies to minimize deterioration.
For the best results, avoid using materials with
high acid content which can cause photos and
paper to deteriorate. Another thing to avoid is
lignin, a material that is the bonding element in
wood fibers. Over time, paper with lignin will become yellow and brittle, so you should
only use lignin-free products.

Basic Materials

• Acid-free paper, card stock, and
stickers
• Acid-free pen, markers, and
adhesive
Acid-free memory book album
●
Straight and pattern edge scissors

Your albums should contain page protectors to shield the pages from smudges, oil, and
dirt that can be transferred from your hands. You should never use albums with sticky
"magnetic" pages.
The sticky substance will be transferred to the photo and backing paper
causing deterioration. Never crop Polaroid photos: they will curl and fall apart. Mount
all memorabilia on acid-free cardstock paper, and photocopy all newspaper clippings on
acid-free paper.
